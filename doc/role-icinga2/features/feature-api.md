## Feature API

The API feature configures the API. The feature will manage
certificate, private key and CA certificate or will create
a certificate signing requests. It also manages the **zones.conf**.

All attributes of the object type [ApiListener](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-2/latest/doc/09-object-types/#apilistener) can be added as keys.

All non Icinga attributes to configure the feature are explained below.

Example how to install an Agent:

> Replace `<PLACEHOLDERS>` according to your environment.

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    force_newcert: false
    parent_host: <ParentNodeFQDN/IPAddress>
    endpoints:
      - name: NodeName
      - name: <ParentNodeName>
        host: <ParentIPAddress>
    zones:
      - name: ZoneName
        parent: <ParentZoneName>
        endpoints:
          - NodeName
      - name: <ParentZoneName>
        endpoints:
          - <ParentNodeName>
```

Example how to install a master/server instance:

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    force_newcert: false
    parent_host: none
    endpoints:
      - name: NodeName
    zones:
      - name: ZoneName
        endpoints:
          - NodeName
```

### Instance with Certificate Authority

To create an instance with a local CA, the API feature parameter `parent_host` should be `none`.

```yaml
parent_host: none
```

### Agent Setup

An agent (or satellite) setup can work in four different ways.

In all cases of auto-signing the master instance must have a secret `TicketSalt` defined.

**On-demand signing:**  
The agent creates a CSR locally and then requests signing via API.  
Manual signing on the master instance is necessary.  
For this, pass an empty ticket `ticket: ""`.  
The `netways.icinga.icinga2_api` module used here will report changes with each execution until the certificate is signed.

**Auto-signing, providing a ticket:**  
The agent can pass a ticket which the master instance can validate.  
If the validation is successful, the agent receives its signed certificate.  
You can use the `netways.icinga.icinga2_ticket` filter to create a valid ticket if you know the secret `TicketSalt`.  
Example: `ticket: "{{ <common_name> | netways.icinga.icinga2_ticket(ticketsalt='<secret_ticket_salt>') }}"`

**Auto-signing, without providing a ticket:**  
Before the agent requests its certificate, the ticket is generated on the master instance.  
For this to work `parent_host` must be the master since ticket creation is delegated to `parent_host`.  
If the `parent_host` is not the master, `icinga2_delegate_host: <inventory_hostname of master>` can be set to delegate there instead.  

**Auto-signing, with reverse connection:**  
Used in environments where the agent cannot connect to its parent but the parent can connect to the agent.  
Here delegation to `parent_host` (or `icinga2_delegate_host`) is used to retrieve the CA certificate and generate a ticket,
so some tasks will be run on `parent_host` (or `icinga2_delegate_host`) directly.  
This requires `delegate_pki: true` to be set.

### Generate Certificate Signing Requests

Create Signing Request to get a certificate managed by the parameter `parent_host` and `parent_port`. If
set to the master/server hostname, FQDN or IP, the node setup tries to connect
via API and retrieve the trusted certificate.

> [!INFO]
> Ansible will delegate the ticket creation to the `parent_host`. You can change this behaviour by setting 'icinga2_delegate_host' to match another Ansible alias.

```yaml
parent_host: icinga-server.localdomain
parent_port: 5665
```

Example if connection should be established to the satellite, resulting in on-demand certificate signing:

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    parent_host: icinga-satellite.localdomain
    ticket: ""
  [...]
```

> In the above case, the `parent_host` is a satellite which does not have the secret `TicketSalt`, so we cannot delegate there for ticket creation.

Example if agent should connect to satellite and the tickets are generated on the master host.

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    parent_host: icinga-satellite.localdomain
  [...]
icinga2_delegate_host: icinga-master.localdomain
```

By default the FQDN is used as certificate common name, to put a name yourself:

> This is not recommended! Apart from endpoints in the master zone and satellite zones (due to the option for high availability)
> every endpoint should use its FQDN as the `cert_name`. This is considered best practice.

```yaml
cert_name: myown-commonname.fqdn
```

To force a new request set `force_newcert` to `true`:

```yaml
force_newcert: true
```

To increase your security set `ca_fingerprint` to validate the CA certificate:

```yaml
ca_fingerprint: "00 DE AD BE EF"
# alternatively
ca_fingerprint: "00:DE:AD:BE:EF"
# or lowercase
ca_fingerprint: "00 de ad be ef"
```

The fingerprint can be retrieved with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in /path/to/ca.crt

# Verbose example for use on the master
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in /var/lib/icinga2/ca/ca.crt | cut -d '=' -f 2 | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' | tr -d ':'
```

### Top-down connections

Use `delegate_pki: true` when the agent cannot initiate a connection to the CA host / master, but the parent / master can connect inbound to the agent.

In this mode, the role:

- fetches `ca.crt` from the `parent_host` via Ansible and copies it to the agent
- generates a self-signed certificate on the agent
- creates a ticket on the `parent_host` via `delegate_to`
- writes the ticket to `{{ icinga2_cert_path }}/ticket`

Icinga then completes certificate signing automatically when the parent connects to the agent and the cluster handshake starts. This is not a fully offline / disconnected workflow.

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    parent_host: icinga-master.localdomain
    delegate_pki: true
    endpoints:
      - name: icinga-agent.localdomain
      - name: icinga-master.localdomain
        # no host here: agent cannot initiate connection anyway
    zones:
      - name: icinga-agent.localdomain
        endpoints:
          - icinga-agent.localdomain
        parent: master
      - name: master
        endpoints:
          - icinga-master.localdomain
### Use your own ready-made certificate

If you want to use certificates which aren't created by **Icinga 2 CA**, then use
the following variables to point the role to your own certificates.

```yaml
ssl_cacert: ca.crt
ssl_cert: certificate.crt
ssl_key: certificate.key
```

> **_NOTE:_** All three parameters have to be set otherwise a signing request is built
and `parent_host` must be defined.

On a config master (`parent_host: none`) the CA private key can additionally be pinned via `ssl_ca_key`. When set, the role places `ca.key` and `ca.crt` under `{{ icinga2_ca_path }}` (default `/var/lib/icinga2/ca/`) so the master can sign agent CSRs with a fixed, externally managed CA. The parameter is ignored on agents and satellites.

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    parent_host: none
    ssl_cacert: /home/ansible/certs/ca.crt
    ssl_ca_key: /home/ansible/certs/ca.key
    ssl_cert: /home/ansible/certs/master.crt
    ssl_key: /home/ansible/certs/master.key
```

The role will copy the files from your Ansible controller node to
**/var/lib/icinga2/certs** on the remote host. File names are
set to by the parameter `cert_name` (by default FQDN).

If the certificates and the key are already present on the remote host,
you can set `ssl_remote_source: true` to change the above behavior.

```yaml
icinga2_features:
  - name: api
    cert_name: host.example.org
    ssl_cacert: /home/ansible/certs/ca.crt
    ssl_cert: /home/ansible/certs/host.crt
    ssl_key: /home/ansible/certs/host.key
    ssl_remote_source: false
    endpoints:
      - name: NodeName
    zones:
      - name: ZoneName
        endpoints:
          - NodeName
```

### Feature variables

* `parent_host: string`
  * Use to decide where to gather the certificates. When set to **none**, Ansible will create a local Certificate Authority on the Host. Use **FQDN**, **hostname** or **ipaddress** as value.

* `force_newcert: boolean`
  * Force new certificates on the destination hosts.

* `force_newca: boolean`
  * Force new CA on the destination hosts (master instance).  
    This of course invalidates the current certificates of all Icinga nodes in the cluster. They also need to be recreated from the new CA.  
    Use with caution!

* `ticket: string`
  * A valid ticket for the given `cert_name`. Used for auto-signing the CSR. Can be generated using the `netways.icinga.icinga2_ticket` filter. If `ticket: ""`, on-demand signing is used.

* `delegate_pki: boolean`
  * Skip outbound `pki save-cert` and `pki request` on the agent. Provision `ca.crt` and ticket through Ansible delegation and rely on Icinga CSR auto-signing when the parent connects inbound.

* `cert_name: string`
  * Common name of Icinga client/server instance. Default is **ansible_facts['fqdn']**.

* `ca_fingerprint: string`
  * SHA256 fingerprint of the CA certificate. If defined, the fingerprint is validated.

* `ssl_cacert: string`
  * Path to the ca file when using manual certificates

* `ssl_cert: string`
  * Path to the certificate file when using manual certificates.

* `ssl_key: string`
  * Path to the certificate key file when using manual certificates.

* `ssl_ca_key: string`
  * Path to the CA private key file. Only effective when `parent_host: none`. When set, `ca.key` and `ca.crt` are placed under `{{ icinga2_ca_path }}` so the master can sign agent CSRs with the provided CA material.

* `ssl_remote_source: boolean`
  * Whether to copy the certificates and key from the remote host instead of from the Ansible controller.

* `endpoints: list of dicts`
  * Defines endpoints in **zones.conf**, each endpoint is required to have a name and optional a host or port.<br>
    * `name: string`
    * `host: string`
    * `port: number`

* `zones: list of dicts`
  * Defines zones in **zones.conf**, each zones is required to have a name and endpoints. The parameter global is optional.
    * `name: string`
    * `endpoints: list`
    * `global: boolean`
    * `parent: string`
